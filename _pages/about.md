I am a Ph.D candidate at [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) (Previous Tokyo Institute of Technology), where I am supervised by [Prof. Konstantinos Slavakis](http://www.slavakislab.ict.e.titech.ac.jp/) and advised by [Prof. Jun Sakuma](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/ai_soc/ai_sec_privacy/index.html). My research focused on intersection of quantum computing, machine learning and security. 

I obtained my B.S. in physics from the [University of California, San Diego](http://ucsd.edu) and M.S. in High Energy Physics from The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAI.

### AI Security 

The on-going work includes the attack on various fine-tuned and pretrained AI models, like Llama2-7B, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen, DeepSeek and GPT family Model. Coming soon! 

### Quantum Machine Learning
Recently, I published research in newly developed feature extraction algorithm on graphs that could be applied with VQCs in limited
