# Dynamic Programming House Robber

## 0/1 Dynamic Programming Overview

The 0/1 Dynamic Programming (DP) pattern is used to solve problems where each item can be either included or excluded (picked or not picked) from a solution. This is common in problems like the classic **Knapsack** and **House Robber**.

### Key Characteristics

- **Binary Choice:** For each element, you decide to take it (1) or leave it (0).
- **Optimal Substructure:** The solution to the problem can be constructed from solutions to its subproblems.
- **Overlapping Subproblems:** The same subproblems are solved multiple times.

### House Robber Problem

Given a row of houses, each with some amount of money, you cannot rob two adjacent houses. Find the maximum amount you can rob.

#### State Definition

Let `dp[i]` be the maximum amount you can rob from the first `i` houses.

#### Recurrence Relation

```
dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
```
- `dp[i-1]`: Skip the current house.
- `dp[i-2] + nums[i]`: Rob the current house and add its value to the best solution two houses before.

#### Base Cases

```
dp[0] = nums[0]
dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
```

#### Example Code (Python)

```python
def rob(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
    dp = [0] * len(nums)
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
    for i in range(2, len(nums)):
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
    return dp[-1]
```

### Space Optimization

Since `dp[i]` only depends on the previous two values, you can reduce space to O(1):

```python
def rob(nums):
    prev, curr = 0, 0
    for num in nums:
        prev, curr = curr, max(curr, prev + num)
    return curr
```
