# Process Management in Operating Systems

## Process States
- Running
- Ready
- Blocked
- Created
- Terminated

## Scheduling Algorithms
### Round Robin
$$ \text{Turnaround Time} = \text{Completion Time} - \text{Arrival Time} $$

### Priority Scheduling
$$ \text{Response Ratio} = \frac{\text{Waiting Time} + \text{Burst Time}}{\text{Burst Time}} $$
